# Disable Customizer

| :warning: | Important notice: This repository is no longer updated. I've released version 2.0 of this plugin, which is [available in the WordPress.org plugin repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-disabler/). Since I've changed the plugin slug from disable-customizer to customizer-disabler, you will need to update to the new version manually. Source code for the new version is available [in a separate GitHub repository.](https://github.com/joppuyo/customizer-disabler) |

Completely disable Customizer on your WordPress site. Useful if you develop custom themes that don't use Customizer.

The code is based on [Customizer Remove All Parts](https://github.com/parallelus/customizer-remove-all-parts) by Jesse Petersen and Andy Wilkerson.
